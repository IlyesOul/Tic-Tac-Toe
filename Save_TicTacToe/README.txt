Welcome to SUPER TIC-TAC-TOE!

This program plays out as regular Tic Tac Toe, but with a twist. Every 'n' placements (decided by user), the first placement for that player will be removed.
For example, if player 'X' placed an X at (X1, Y1), then played his fourth X when 'n' is 3, the X at (X1, Y1) would be removed.

This program utilizes HashSets, as well as a dynamic Linked-List as auxilary storages.
The language is Java
