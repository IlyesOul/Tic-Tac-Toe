Welcome to SUPER TIC-TAC-TOE!

This program plays out as regular Tic Tac Toe but with a twist. For every 'n' placements (decided by the user), the first placement for that player will be removed. For example, if player 'X' placed an X at some (X1, Y1), then played his fourth X when 'n' is 3, the X at (X1, Y1) would be removed.

The user also has the power to customize how many pieces in a row it takes to win, as well as the dimensions of the row.

This program utilizes custom-made HashSets, objects for each X/O, as well as a dynamic Linked List as auxiliary storage.
The primary language that is used is Java
